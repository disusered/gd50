    Represents a brick in the world space that the ball can collide with;
    differently colored bricks have different point values. On collision,
    the ball will bounce away depending on the angle of collision. When all
    bricks are cleared in the current map, the player should be taken to a new
    layout of bricks.

    - [x] Update bricks table to include locked brick
    - [x] Add flag to Brick class to determine if brick is locked
    - [x] Render locked brick if flag is set
    - [x] Add particle effect to locked brick
    - [x] Don't play sound on locked brick hit or destruction
    - [x] Add custom sound for locked brick hit
    - [x] Set locked brick to lowest tier
    - [x] Don't allow locked brick to be destroyed unless condition is met
    - [x] Spawn locked brick with LevelMaker
    - [x] Render powerup to unlock locked brick
    - [x] Add sound for unlock powerup
    - [x] Calculate number of hits to beat level
    - [x] Spawn unlock powerup once per level
    - [x] Respawn powerup if not collected
    - [x] Add custom sound for when unlocked powerup is collected
